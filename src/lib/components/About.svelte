        Cam Hack is a 32 hour hackathon for the innovative minds at
        the University of Cambridge. Over an action-packed weekend, students
        come together to design and build technology projects from the ground
        up. We welcome participants ranging from curious beginners to seasoned
        coders. Expect plenty of free stash, food, and mini-events throughout
        this hackathon.
